# Hi, I'm Haowei (Howard) Cao 👋

I'm a **Software Engineer** with experience building production software across **distributed systems, ML inference platforms, and user-facing applications**.

I enjoy working on problems at the intersection of **engineering, performance, and real-world deployment**, and I care a lot about writing clean, reliable code that actually ships.

- **Production software & services**  
  Building and optimizing backend services, inference pipelines, and internal tools used in real-world systems.

- **ML & AI infrastructure**  
  Experience supporting model inference workflows, performance optimization (latency, throughput), and monitoring/observability.

- **Web & user-facing features**  
  Collaborating with frontend and backend components to deliver usable, performant features backed by APIs and services.
